                                The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) is a premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research in distributed and event-based computing and data processing. DEBS 2026 will be a forum dedicated to disseminating original research, discussing practical insights, and reporting experiences relevant to distributed and event‐based systems.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Tutorials</h1>

                            <p>
                                DEBS 2026 will host a one-day, multi-track tutorial program to provide independent instruction on topics related to distributed and event-based computing, both fitting for the research audience and an industrial audience. We solicit both <b>long (2 sessions)</b> and <b>short (1 session)</b> tutorials. The topic should relate to event-based systems and methods. Submissions can target a particular distributed system technology or a more general problem area of interest to the DEBS community, i.e., middleware, architectures, and design approaches to collecting, detecting, processing, and responding to events. Tutorials on emerging enterprise-level infrastructures and/or popular (open source) software platforms are also highly welcome. Yet, please note that no marketing or product-specific tutorials will be accepted. Tutorial levels may be introductory, intermediate, or advanced.

                                Proposers of accepted tutorials or workshops are given the opportunity to submit a paper to be published in the DEBS Proceedings. The content of the paper must be on the material covered by the tutorial/workshop and must not exceed 4 pages. Submitted papers will be reviewed prior to publication and may be rejected for publication if either the technical quality of the paper is insufficient or the content of the paper does not match the content of the event. Note that the rejection of a tutorial/workshop paper does not imply a rejection of the tutorial/workshop itself. Tutorial/workshop papers will be published in the conference proceedings as part of the ACM International Proceedings Series and will be disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.
