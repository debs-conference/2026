              <h1>Overview of Chalmers University of Technology</h1>
              <p>Chalmers University of Technology (Swedish: Chalmers tekniska högskola, commonly referred to as
                Chalmers) is located in Gothenburg, Sweden, and focuses on engineering and science, but more broadly it
                also conducts research and offers education in shipping, architecture and management. <br>
                Chalmers was founded in 1829. The university was run as a private institution until 1937 when it became
                the second state-owned technical university. In 1994 the government of Sweden reorganised Chalmers into
                a private company owned by a government-controlled foundation. Chalmers is one of only three
                universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being Karolinska Institutet and
                Linnaeus University.</p>

                10 minutes, plus another 10 minutes for walking. Alternatively, you can take trams 7 or 10 (stop A) to
                Brunnsparken. The travelling and walking time are similar. If you prefer to walk, that will take
                approximately 25 minutes.</p>
