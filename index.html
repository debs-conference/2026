          <p>
            CI√äNCIAS celebrated its 1st centenary in 2011 and its history can be
            traced back to the creation of Portugal's first university, the
            University of Lisbon, in 1288.<br><br>

            It is recognised as one of the most prestigious teaching and
            research institutions in Portugal, particularly in the sciences and
            related areas. This recognition comes from the quality of its
            programmes, which include 17 bachelor's degrees, 40 master's degrees
            and 21 doctorates, reflected in an employability rate of 98%.<br><br>

            The Faculty is home to 13 research centres, recognised by the
            Foundation for Science and Technology, and stands out for its
            commitment to excellence in research and innovation. This commitment
            is evident in its per capita performance, which is the best in the
            University of Lisbon. The Tec Labs innovation centre, located on
            campus, is home to 35 start-ups, 6 of them international, with a
            focus on science and health.<br><br>
