          <p>
            Chalmers University of Technology (Swedish: Chalmers tekniska högskola, commonly referred to as Chalmers)
            is located in Gothenburg, Sweden, and focuses on engineering and science, but more broadly it also
            conducts research and offers education in shipping, architecture and management. <br><br>
            Chalmers was founded in 1829. The university was run as a private institution until 1937 when it became
            the second state-owned technical university. In 1994 the government of Sweden reorganised
            Chalmers into a private company owned by a government-controlled foundation. Chalmers is
            one of only three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two
            being Karolinska Institutet and Linnaeus University.
