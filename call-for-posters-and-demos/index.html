                            <h1>Demos</h1>
                            <p>Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes or operational systems. Demonstrations also provide opportunities to exchange ideas gained from implementing event-based systems and obtain expert user feedback.</p>

                            <p>Demonstration submissions are welcomed in any of the areas identified in the conference's scope (see <a href="https://2025.debs.org">2025.debs.org</a> for the detailed scope).</p>

                            <p>Demonstration submissions describe the objectives and findings the demonstration addresses, in 2-4 pages, following the ACM format for the conference proceedings. All demo submissions should have the prefix “Demo:” in their title.</p>

                            <p>All submissions are strongly encouraged, but not required, to provide in their submission a URL to a live online version of their demo, or to a video showcasing the main demo features (this is intended for the sole purpose of submission review and selection).</p>

                            <p>Demonstrations that make their source code freely available are strongly encouraged, and a requirement to be considered for the best demo award.</p>

                            <p>Accepted contributions will be published (excluding the appendix) by ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.</p>

                            <h1>Posters</h1>

                            <p>Poster presentations offer researchers an excellent forum to present and discuss preliminary research findings as well as novel and original ideas related to DEBS.</p>

                            <p>Poster submissions describe ideas, approaches, and possibly preliminary findings, following the ACM format for the conference proceedings using <b>up to 2 pages</b>. All poster submissions should have the prefix “Poster:” in their title.</p>

                            <p>Accepted contributions will be published by ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.</p>

                                    The authors of accepted papers will choose between different copyright agreements according to ACM policies.
                                    The options will include opportunities for open access and the traditional ACM copyright agreement.
                                </p>

                                    By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors 
                                    are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies">ACM Publications Policies</a>, 
                                    including 
                                    <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects">ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated 
                                    by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, 
                                    as per ACM Publications Policy.

                                    Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an <a href="https://orcid.org/register">ORCID ID</a>, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. 
                                    ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs">commitment to collect ORCID IDs from 
                                        all of our published authors</a>. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and 
                                    contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
