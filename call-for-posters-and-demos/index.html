                            <h1>Demos</h1>
                            <p>Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes or operational systems. Demonstrations also provide opportunities to exchange ideas gained from implementing event-based systems and obtain expert user feedback.</p>

                            <p>Demonstration submissions are welcomed in any of the areas identified in the conference's scope (see <a href="https://2026.debs.org">2026.debs.org</a> for the detailed scope).</p>

                            <p>Demonstration submissions describe the objectives and findings the demonstration addresses, in 2-4 pages, following the ACM format for the conference proceedings. All demo submissions should have the prefix “Demo:” in their title.</p>

                            <p>All submissions are strongly encouraged, but not required, to provide in their submission a URL to a live online version of their demo, or to a video showcasing the main demo features (this is intended for the sole purpose of submission review and selection).</p>

                            <p>Demonstrations that make their source code freely available are strongly encouraged, and a requirement to be considered for the best demo award.</p>

                            <p>Accepted contributions will be published (excluding the appendix) by ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.</p>

                            <p>Poster presentations offer researchers an excellent forum to present and discuss preliminary research findings as well as novel and original ideas related to DEBS.</p>

                            <p>Poster submissions describe ideas, approaches, and possibly preliminary findings, following the ACM format for the conference proceedings using <b>up to 2 pages</b>. All poster submissions should have the prefix “Poster:” in their title.</p>

                            <p>Accepted contributions will be published by ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.</p>
