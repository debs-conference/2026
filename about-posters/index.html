                <h2>Poster Printing Information for DEBS 2025 Participants</h2>

                <p>
                  In addition to the accepted Posters and Demos, all accepted contributions to the Research and Industry
                  tracks are also invited to bring a poster to the conference. This offers a great opportunity to foster
                  additional discussions during the poster session. The preferred poster size is <strong>A1</strong>,
                  but <strong>A0</strong> is also possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you prefer to print your poster on-site rather than bringing it with you, Chalmers printing
                  services are available. There are two ways to proceed:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Option 1: Email Submission and On-Site Payment</strong><br>

                    Please indicate in the email if you prefer the poster to be printed in <strong>A1 size</strong>;
                    otherwise, the default size will be <strong>A0</strong>.<br>
                    Once your poster is ready, you will receive a confirmation reply. You can then collect it in person
                    and pay <strong>on-site at the printing service</strong>.<br>
                    <em>Important:</em> Please send the email <strong>at least two working days</strong> before you plan
