                            <p>
                                The DEBS 2026 Industry and Application Track invites submissions on innovative design,
                                development, or deployment of event-based and distributed systems and applications.
                                Contributions will be reviewed by researchers and industry practitioners working in
                                distributed and event-based computing.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                An important goal of DEBS is to enrich and cultivate cooperation and exchange between
                                researchers and practitioners who work on distributed and event-based systems. Such
                                interactions help practitioners to become aware of leading-edge research that can
                                address issues and problems in commercial systems, while also allowing researchers to
                                learn more about details and concerns with event-based and distributed applications and
                                systems that arise in commercial implementations and deployments.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Submissions should present novel work and experiences related to distributed and
                                event-based systems with a particular focus on industrial systems and applied research.
                                Relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
                            </p>

                                Finally, as DEBS 2026 places emphasis on reproducibility, we also encourage authors of
                                Industry and Application papers to make available all data used for empirical
                                evaluation, the related software as well as clear instructions for reproducing the
                                presented experiments, as a form of supplementary material. The reviewers will be
                                encouraged to consider this material.

                                Industry and Applications Track papers should cover some novel use or development of
                                event-based applications or distributed systems, with an industry theme, and must be no
                                longer than 12 pages. We also welcome short papers no longer than 6 pages. Each
                                submission must be original, unpublished and cannot be under review for another
                                publishing forum during the time it is under submission to DEBS 2026.

                                Application Program Committee. This track will use a single-blind process, unlike the
                                double-blind reviews in the Research Track, so information about the authors and their
                                affiliations should be present in all submissions.
