                                <b>Regular papers</b>: this category is open to research papers of both theoretical
                                and experimental nature with novel and original research contributions. Regular papers
                                must be no longer than 12 pages, including references.
                            </li>

                                and/or visions on emerging research challenges. Preliminary results from original
                                research may also be presented, where some aspects of the work remain open, possibly
                                with initial or limited evaluation. Short papers must be no longer than 6 pages,
                                including references.

                                A submitted paper cannot be under review
                                for any other conference or journal during the time it is considered for DEBS 2026,
                                and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.

                                The Research Track adopts a double-blind review process for both categories of papers,
                                where neither authors nor reviewers know each other‚Äôs identities. This means that
                                submitted papers must be anonymous (not revealing author names). References to
                                authors‚Äô previous work should be done in the third person to not reveal their
                                identities.
                                There should be no acknowledgments of people or projects. Supplementary material
                                (e.g., GitHub or GitLab repository) should not reveal the authors‚Äô identities;
                                to this end, anonymized repositories can be used (e.g.,
                                <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science">https://anonymous.4open.science</a>).

                                Double-blind reviewing does not preclude submitting work intended for DEBS 2026 to
                                preprint
                                services such as arXiv. However, authors are encouraged to use preventive measures
                                to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a sufficiently
                                different title for their preprint submission).

                                DEBS 2024 adopts a dual-deadline model, with a submission deadline in the Fall and
                                another one in the Spring.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Authors of papers receiving a Reject decision for the Fall deadline are not allowed to
                                resubmit to the Spring deadline for DEBS 2024. There are, however, no constraints for a
                                resubmission to a future edition of DEBS.

                                In specific cases, the program committee may decide to offer a one-shot revision
                                decision for authors of papers submitted to the Fall deadline, that would be considered
                                promising but lacking in presentation or clarity. In this case, authors will have the
                                possibility to send an updated version to the Spring deadline for reevaluation.
