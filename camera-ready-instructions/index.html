                                to the appropriate ACM electronic form to sign. The ACM form usually only takes moments
                                to complete. <b>Please give this matter your immediate attention, after you receive the

                            <p><b>Note:</b> Usually, only one ACM copyright form is needed, and it can
                                be signed by the lead or contact author. A second form may be requested from
                                co-presenters depending on any US or foreign government affiliations. The ACM
                                Copyrights-Permission office will notify you if a second form is needed.</p>

                            <p>ACM provides a template for Microsoft Word and a template for LaTeX.
                                However, ACM is currently in the process of revamping its Word template. <b>We highly
                                    recommend using the LaTeX template.</b></p>

                            <h3>
                                <font size="5">Microsoft Word instructions</font>
                            </h3>

                            <p>Please download the ACM “Interim Template” Word document (Interim
                                layout.docx) from ACM <a
                                    href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>. There is also
                                a sample PDF file produced with the Word template.</p>

                            <p>We strongly encourage you to review the sample file above so you will be
                                aware of the mandatory sections, copyright strip information (see next step), formatting
                                requirements, font requirements, font sizes, and spacing required for the final version.
                            </p>

                            <p>The correct ACM DEBS {{site.data.dates.conference_year}} copyright-permission notice needs to be
                                inserted in the sample files above, see page 1, bottom of column 1 before you submit
                                your final version. The ACM rights management process will email the lead author this
                                information when the online ACM copyright form is completed. There are three different
                                forms of copyright block. ACM rights management system will automatically send you the
                                correct copyright text based on the form you choose. A custom DOI URL will also be
                                included in that email.</p>

                            <p>Please double-check that your produced document matches the details in
                                the email sent you by the rights management system, and that you have included your full
                                DOI URL.</p>

                            <p>This statement must be in 7 point Libertine font, with the first
                                paragraph text justified, with DEBS ‘23 (the venue acronym) in italics. Refer to the
                                “Interim-layout.docx” sample file to view how the ACM copyright statement should appear
                                -- you should preserve the original formatting.</p>

                            <p><b>Note:</b> the main problem that occurs with submissions generated with
                                pdflatex is that the fonts are not embedded properly. This most often occurs because
                                vector images included from your LaTeX do not themselves embed their fonts. If we find
                                problems with your PDF, and you are unable to submit a revised version with correctly
                                embedded fonts, we may have to take a less desirable and less safe route: that you
                                submit a PostScript (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.</p>

                            <p><b>Template:</b> Please use <b>the sigconf proceedings template</b> from

                                section). Please follow the instructions given on the page, and please have a look /
                                start from the sample file “sample-sigconf.tex” in the acmart package. Even if you have
                                already downloaded the package for another conference, you should download it again as
                                ACM often makes changes to their template and publishes new versions. If you submit a
                                paper using an outdated version of the template, you might be required to update to a
                                newer version.</p>

                            <p><b>Fonts:</b> <b>Type 1 or TrueType fonts must be used</b> (this will
                                usually happen by default). <b>Type 3 fonts are not permitted.</b> TrueType fonts are
                                permitted, but will be tested for any problems which may need to be rectified. For help
                                on obtaining the correct type of fonts, see this <a

                            </h3>

                            <p>Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column breaks. One example
                                of a bad column break is a widow, which occurs when the last line of a paragraph that
                                begins at the bottom of one column appears by itself at the top of the next column). If
                                this happens, tighten the previous column to bring it back, or force an additional line
                                of text over to the next column.</p>

                            <p>Also make sure that Section and Sub-section headings have at least two
                                lines of body text below them when they appear at the end of a page or column.</p>

                            </h3>

                            <p>In the event, any element used in your material contains the work of
                                third-parties, it is the author/presenter’s responsibility to secure any necessary
                                permissions and/or licenses, and the authors will provide the same permissions in
                                writing to the ACM. If the copyright holder requires a citation to a copyrighted work,
                                it is the authors’ responsibility to include the correct wording and citations to the
                                copyrighted material in their submissions.</p>

                            <h3>
                                <font size="5">Images and figures</font>
                            </h3>

                            <p>Below are some recommendations to ensure good print reproduction of the
                                images, figures, and illustrations utilized in your submission.</p>

                            <p><b>Colors and Black &amp; White (Gray Scale) Print Testing.</b> If you
                                have any images in color, please print your paper out in black and white to ensure that
                                the tones and screens used in your images or figures reproduce well in black and white,
                                too. However, your images will appear in full color in any distributed electronic
                                proceedings and in the ACM digital library.</p>

                            <p><b>Resolution &amp; CMYK.</b> Figures, charts, and diagrams should use a
                                vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images (e.g. photographs) should be at least
                                300 or 600 dpi for quality reproduction and saved as .tiff images (or other compatible
                                formats that support print-quality resolution). When creating or revising your images
                                for inclusion in the paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as the color
                                profile.</p>

                            <p><b>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) image.</b> For raster images (e.g. photos),
                                TIFFs are preferred for press applications where quality takes priority over file size.
                                When TIFFs are compressed (using LZW compression option when saving from Adobe
                                Photoshop, for example), no image data is lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is
                                a compressed image format designed to keep the file size small, which makes it ideal for
                                use in web graphics. However, to achieve this, the JPEG format actually removes
                                precision from the image. This is referred to as a lossy compression system. On a
                                printout, the removed data tends to show up as blocky areas of a solid color, or
                                ghosting near high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions (a minimum of 200 dpi),
                                there’s usually enough data in the JPEG file for the compression artefacts to be very
                                noticeable.</p>

                            <p><b>Rules/Lines.</b> Rules used in your graphs, tables or charts must be
                                at least 0.5 point in stroke and black for quality reproduction. Finer lines and points
                                than this will not reproduce well, even if you can see them on your laser printed
                                hardcopy when checked — your laser printers will usually have a far lower resolution
                                than the imagesetters that will be used.</p>

                            <p><b>Fonts.</b> If your figure uses custom or any non-standard font, the
                                characters may appear differently when printed in the proceedings. Remember to check
                                your figure creation to ensure that all fonts are embedded or included in the figure
                                correctly. <b>Be sure that your images do not contain any Type 3 fonts.</b></p>

                            <p><b>Transparency.</b> If a figure or image is assembled from multiple
                                images, the images must be embedded, and layers be flattened or grouped together
                                properly in the file. <b>Transparency must be flattened.</b></p>

                            <h3>
                                <font size="5">Page numbering, headers, and footers</font>
                            </h3>

                            <p>Your final submission <b>MUST NOT</b> contain any footer string at the
                                bottom of each page nor any page numbering. The submissions will be paginated in a
                                determined order by the chairs and page numbers added to the PDF during the compiling,
                                indexing, and pagination process.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, your final submission <b>MUST NOT</b> contain any header
                                string information at the top of the first page. On following pages, the header has to
                                contain the conference information (left) and the author names (right) on even pages and
                                the title (left) and the event information (right) on odd pages. Please make sure that
                                the different information in the header does not overlap each other. If, for example,
                                the list of authors is too long, you may use a more concise version such as “John Smith
                                et al.” for the header. See pages 2-6 of the <a
