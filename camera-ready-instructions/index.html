                                In order to finalize the procedure of publication of their accepted contribution, the
                                authors have to complete the following two steps:

                                in the form that you will put in your final PDF. Additionally, we recommend that authors
                                agree to videotaping in the eRights form, as talks might be streamed and made available
                                on demand after the conference.

                                The publishing system automatically produces the traditional PDF output and ACM's new
                                responsive HTML5 design. Within 24 hours after submitting the .zip file, the contact
                                author will receive the 'PDF and HTML Proofs: available for review' email notifying that
                                the proofs for the published versions of your paper (both PDF and HTML5 versions) are
                                available for your review and approval. Note that TAPS will generate the output PDF
                                using the double-column format, which follows the “sigconf” proceedings template. TAPS
                                receives the information from ACM's system regarding which composition layout needs to
                                be followed for the papers in your proceedings (i.e., “sigconf” in this case) and
                                applies the required style internally.

                                ACM accepts the submission of Auxiliary Materials – i.e. additional files not formally
                                part of the publication – as an additional resource for the reader. ACM does not take
                                copyright for these files, but to serve them, still needs permission from the owner and
                                an agreement that the author is abiding by ACM's terms when supplying the files. If you
                                intend to submit Auxiliary Materials, please check Part II of the e-Rights form and
                                saying YES to the terms grants ACM permission to publish them.

                                Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column breaks. One example of a bad
                                column break is a widow, which occurs when the last line of a paragraph that begins at
                                the bottom of one column appears by itself at the top of the next column). If this
                                happens, tighten the previous column to bring it back, or force an additional line of
                                text over to the next column.

                                you have any images in color, please print your paper out in black and white
                                to ensure that the tones and screens used in your images or figures
                                reproduce well in black and white, too. However, your images will appear in
                                full color in any distributed electronic proceedings and in the ACM digital
                                library.

                                <strong>Resolution &amp; CMYK.</strong> Figures, charts, and diagrams should
                                use a vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images (e.g. photographs)
                                should be at least 300 or 600 dpi for quality reproduction and saved as
                                .tiff images (or other compatible formats that support print-quality
                                resolution). When creating or revising your images for inclusion in the
                                paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as the color profile.

                                <strong>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) image.</strong> For raster images (e.g.
                                photos), TIFFs are preferred for press applications where quality takes
                                priority over file size. When TIFFs are compressed (using LZW compression
                                option when saving from Adobe Photoshop, for example), no image data is
                                lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a compressed image format
                                designed to keep the file size small, which makes it ideal for use in web
                                graphics. However, to achieve this, the JPEG format actually removes
                                precision from the image. This is referred to as a lossy compression system.
                                On a printout, the removed data tends to show up as blocky areas of a solid
                                color, or ghosting near high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions
                                (a minimum of 200 dpi), there's usually enough data in the JPEG file for the
                                compression artefacts to be very noticeable.

                                <strong>Rules/Lines.</strong> Rules used in your graphs, tables or charts
                                must be at least 0.5 point in stroke and black for quality reproduction.
                                Finer lines and points than this will not reproduce well, even if you can
                                see them on your laser printed hardcopy when checked — your laser printers
                                will usually have a far lower resolution than the imagesetters that will be
                                used.

                                <strong>Fonts.</strong> If your figure uses custom or any non-standard font,
                                the characters may appear differently when printed in the proceedings.
                                Remember to check your figure creation to ensure that all fonts are embedded
                                or included in the figure correctly.

                                If changes are needed, you will be contacted by one of the publication
                                coordinators in case you need to fix something. If this is true, you will
                                receive specific information about how to revise your submission to meet
                                requirements, and a new deadline will be given to submit the corrected
                                material. You are required by the chairs to adhere to this NEW deadline so
                                publication is not delayed.
