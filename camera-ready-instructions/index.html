                                In order to finalize the procedure of publication of their accepted contribution, the
                                authors have to complete the following two steps:

                                agree to videotaping in the eRights form, as talks might be streamed and made available
                                on demand after the conference.

                                The publishing system automatically produces the traditional PDF output and ACM's new
                                responsive HTML5 design. Within 24 hours after submitting the .zip file, the contact
                                author will receive the 'PDF and HTML Proofs: available for review' email notifying that
                                the proofs for the published versions of your paper (both PDF and HTML5 versions) are
                                available for your review and approval. Note that TAPS will generate the output PDF
                                using the double-column format, which follows the "sigconf" proceedings template. TAPS
                                receives the information from ACM's system regarding which composition layout needs to
                                be followed for the papers in your proceedings (i.e., "sigconf" in this case) and
                                applies the required style internally.

                                ACM accepts the submission of Auxiliary Materials – i.e. additional files not formally
                                part of the publication – as an additional resource for the reader. ACM does not take
                                copyright for these files, but to serve them, still needs permission from the owner and
                                an agreement that the author is abiding by ACM's terms when supplying the files. If you
                                intend to submit Auxiliary Materials, please check Part II of the e-Rights form and
                                saying YES to the terms grants ACM permission to publish them.

                                Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column breaks. One example of a bad
                                column break is a widow, which occurs when the last line of a paragraph that begins at
                                the bottom of one column appears by itself at the top of the next column). If this
                                happens, tighten the previous column to bring it back, or force an additional line of
                                text over to the next column.

                                please print your paper out in black and white to ensure that the tones and screens used
                                in your images or figures reproduce well in black and white, too. However, your images
                                will appear in full color in any distributed electronic proceedings and in the ACM
                                digital library.

                                <b>Resolution &amp; CMYK.</b> Figures, charts, and diagrams should use a
                                vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images (e.g. photographs) should be at least
                                300 or 600 dpi for quality reproduction and saved as .tiff images (or other compatible
                                formats that support print-quality resolution). When creating or revising your images
                                for inclusion in the paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as the color
                                profile.
                            </p>

                                <b>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) image.</b> For raster images (e.g. photos), TIFFs are
                                preferred for press applications where quality takes priority over file size. When TIFFs
                                are compressed (using LZW compression option when saving from Adobe Photoshop, for
                                example), no image data is lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a compressed
                                image format designed to keep the file size small, which makes it ideal for use in web
                                graphics. However, to achieve this, the JPEG format actually removes precision from the
                                image. This is referred to as a lossy compression system. On a printout, the removed
                                data tends to show up as blocky areas of a solid color, or ghosting near high-contrast
                                changes. At higher print resolutions (a minimum of 200 dpi), there's usually enough data
                                in the JPEG file for the compression artefacts to be very noticeable.
                            </p>

                                <b>Rules/Lines.</b> Rules used in your graphs, tables or charts must be at least 0.5
                                point in stroke and black for quality reproduction. Finer lines and points than this
                                will not reproduce well, even if you can see them on your laser printed hardcopy when
                                checked — your laser printers will usually have a far lower resolution than the
                                imagesetters that will be used.

                                <b>Fonts.</b> If your figure uses custom or any non-standard font, the characters may
                                appear differently when printed in the proceedings. Remember to check your figure
                                creation to ensure that all fonts are embedded or included in the figure correctly. Be
                                sure that your images do not contain any Type 3 fonts.

                                <b>Transparency.</b> If a figure or image is assembled from multiple images, the images
                                must be embedded, and layers be flattened or grouped together properly in the file.
                                Transparency must be flattened.
